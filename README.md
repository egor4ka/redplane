# redplane
An AUR helper written in sh and then rewritten in Nim

# Installation
To install, either download and chmod the .sh version,
or install the nim package and run
```
nim compile redplane.nim
```

# Usage
Running redplane -h should tell you all you need

# Why would I use it over any other pacman wrapper?
No idea, i created this just to test my nim knowledge, if you want a decent AUR helper check out pakku.

# Why the fuck is it in both Nim and Bash?
Because I have a workflow: write a utility in Bash, and then rewrite it in nim.
